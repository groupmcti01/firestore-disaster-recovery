# Terraform Google Cloud Storage Module

This module makes it easy to create a GCS bucket to backup a Firestore Database, and assign basic permissions.

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13+.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "bucket" {
  source  = "modules/bucket"
  version = "~> 5.0"

  name       = "bucket-name"
  project_id = "project-id"
  location   = "northamerica-northeast1"
  iam_members = [{
    role   = "roles/storage.objectViewer"
    member = "user:user@labroom.online"
  }]
}
```
